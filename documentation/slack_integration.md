# Slack integration

Slack has become a popular communication tool that brings Managers, DevOps and Engineering team members together in their daily tasks. 
You can connect your Slack account with SynOps to access SynOps functionality [directly from Slack](https://github.com/synycs-dev/extract_linked_reports/blob/main/slacker%20/README.md).

To prepare your SynOps cluster for Slack integration, follow these instructions: [synycs-dev/extract_linked_reports/slacker/README.md](../slacker/README.md)
