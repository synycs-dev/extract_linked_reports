# Slack integration

Slack has become a popular communication tool that brings Managers, DevOps and Engineering team members together in their daily tasks. 
You can connect your Slack account with SynOps to access SynOps functionality [directly from Slack](https://hystax.com/documentation/optscale/integrations.html#slack-app).

To prepare your SynOps cluster for Slack integration, follow these instructions: [SynOps/slacker/README.md](../slacker/README.md)
